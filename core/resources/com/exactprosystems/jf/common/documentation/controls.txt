{{`The tool can operate with all types of controls, which usually are used in applications. But every kind of application 
has its own specific control set. For example in web applications there are not the such control as {{$ScrollBar$}}
The such control is not allowed to use even in the related dictionary. If the such control is used for example 
in dynamic locator the error with kind {{@CONTROL_NOT_SUPPORTED@}} will appear.`}}
{{`Also not all operations can be applied to every control.   
Due dynamic types of underlying expression language ({{$MVEL$}}) it is impossible to check operations before matrix starts.
In case of using not permitted operation for a control the error with kind {{@OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED@}}
will be generated.`}} 
{{`The list of all controls and operations allowed for them you can find in the tables below. Mark "+" means that operations
from the column allowed for control in the row. If this one is the operation by default the color of this mark is red.`}}
{{`Operations can be used in action {{$DialogFill$}}. It is the main action used for manipulating elements on screen.
Extra parameters of this action are list of controls for pointed dialog. Values of these parameters converted into 
chains of operations. Look at the example:
{{#
Do.click().delay(100).getValue()
#}}
This expression will be converted into 3 operations: left mouse click, delay 100 ms and getting value from the element.
All this operations will be performed one by one and if noone from them is not failed the whole operation is not failed too.
Result of the last operation getValue() can be accessed in matrix by {{$DialogFill$}} action reference.
