since 578 you need to remove following sections in your config:

    <JVMparameters>
    <JVMclasspath>
    <JREpath>
    <serverLog>
    <serverLogLevel>
    <serverLogPattern>
    
since 643 logs were separated to several files according their packages. 
now logs are put into 'logs' directory. remove old main.log file in current directory.
